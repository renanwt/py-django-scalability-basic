# ðŸš€ Building Scalable APIs with Python, Django, and REST Framework

This repository showcases a practical example of building a scalable API using Python, Django, and Django REST Framework (DRF). It focuses on implementing key scalability principles directly within the application code, providing a foundation for robust and high-performance web services.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Features Implemented

This sample API provides a basic product management interface with:

*   **Product Listing:** Retrieve a list of products.
*   **Pagination:** Efficiently handle large datasets by breaking results into manageable pages.
*   **Search & Filtering:** Allow users to search products by keywords and filter by specific criteria (e.g., price, stock).
*   **Rate Limiting:** Protect the API from abuse and ensure fair resource usage by limiting the number of requests clients can make.
*   **Caching:** Demonstrate how to implement caching for read-heavy operations to reduce database load and improve response times.
*   **Asynchronous Task Mention:** Illustrate the conceptual integration of background tasks for long-running operations.

## Scalability Principles Demonstrated in Code

The following techniques are applied within the Django application to promote scalability:

*   **Efficient Database Queries:** Use of Django ORM features (e.g., `order_by`, `select_related`, `prefetch_related` for complex models) to ensure consistent pagination and efficient data retrieval, minimizing N+1 query problems.
*   **Pagination:** Implemented via DRF's `PageNumberPagination` to limit the number of records per response, preventing large data transfers.
*   **Filtering and Searching:** Leveraging `django-filter` and DRF's built-in `SearchFilter` and `OrderingFilter` to offload data processing to the database, allowing for more precise and faster queries.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Configured through DRF's throttling classes (`AnonRateThrottle`, `UserRateThrottle`) to control API access, preventing denial-of-service attacks and ensuring resource availability.
*   **Caching:** Utilizes Django's caching framework (`@cache_page` decorator for entire views and manual `cache.get`/`cache.set` for specific data) to store frequently accessed data in memory, significantly reducing database hits and improving response times for read-heavy endpoints.
*   **Asynchronous Processing (Concept):** A placeholder for integrating external task queues (like Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ) for long-running or background operations (e.g., sending notifications, complex data processing), ensuring API responsiveness.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/py-django-scalability-basic.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd py-django-scalability-basic
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install Django djangorestframework django-filter
    ```
4.  **Apply database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations products
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
5.  **Create a superuser (optional, for Django Admin access):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
6.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## API Usage

The API endpoints are accessible under the `/api/` prefix.

### Products

*   **List Products (GET):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/`
    *   **Pagination:** Add `?page=2` or `?page_size=20`.
    *   **Filtering:** `?price__gte=50.00`, `?stock__lte=10`.
    *   **Searching:** `?search=shirt`.
    *   **Ordering:** `?ordering=-price` (descending by price), `?ordering=name` (ascending by name).
    *   **Caching:** Subsequent GET requests to this endpoint will be served from cache for a short period (60 seconds by default for `list` method).

*   **Retrieve Product Detail (GET):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/{id}/`
    *   Example: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/1/`

*   **Retrieve Product Detail with Custom Cache (GET):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/{id}/cached_detail/`
    *   Example: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/1/cached_detail/`
    *   Demonstrates manual caching for specific actions on an object.

*   **Create Product (POST):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/`
    *   **Body (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
            "name": "Basic T-Shirt",
            "description": "100% cotton basic t-shirt.",
            "price": "29.99",
            "stock": 150
        }
        ```

*   **Update Product (PUT/PATCH):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/{id}/`
    *   **Body (JSON):** (Similar to POST, provide fields to update)

*   **Delete Product (DELETE):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/{id}/`

*   **Trigger Async Notification (POST):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/{id}/notify_update/`
    *   *(Note: This is a placeholder. Actual asynchronous processing with Celery or similar would require additional setup not fully implemented in this basic example.)*

### Rate Limiting

*   Anonymous users are limited to 100 requests per minute.
*   Authenticated users are limited to 1000 requests per minute.
*   Exceeding the limit will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Scaling Beyond the Code (Infrastructure Considerations)

While this project demonstrates in-code scalability, a truly scalable production environment would also involve:

*   **Load Balancing:** Distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances of the API (e.g., Nginx, AWS ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancing) to handle increased user load and provide high availability.
*   **Dedicated Database:** Using a robust, optimized database server (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) separate from the application server, potentially with read replicas for scaling read operations.
*   **Distributed Cache:** Utilizing external, high-performance caching services (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for shared, in-memory caching across multiple application instances.
*   **Message Queues:** Implementing a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis with Celery, AWS SQS) for reliable asynchronous task processing, decoupling long-running jobs from the main request-response cycle.
*   **Containerization & Orchestration:** Deploying with Docker and managing with Kubernetes for easy scaling, deployment, and management of multiple microservice instances, enabling horizontal scaling.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry, or cloud-native monitoring services for real-time performance tracking, error logging, and proactive alerting.
*   **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** For static assets and potentially cacheable API responses, to serve content closer to users globally, reducing latency.
